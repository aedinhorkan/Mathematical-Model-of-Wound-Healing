# Mathematical-Model-of-Wound-Healing üíªüë©‚Äçüî¨
As part of my final year project, I developed a series of three progressively complex mathematical models to simulate the wound healing process in cell culture. The project lasted six months and was a blend of theoretical physics and computational biologyü¶†üíª. 

Understanding wound healing is an essential part of biomedical research which translates into better treatments for chronic or hard to heal wounds. In this work, the biological principles which govern wound healing are combined with mathematics to gain insights into cell behaviour during wound healing. The principal aim is to develop mathematical models that will simulate these behaviours. A series of models were constructed to investigate this process.

‚ú®The first model demonstrates the growth of a single population of cells on a lattice. Through simulations, the cell population was assessed to see how it evolves over time based on a variety of initial parameters. Results from this model behaved consistently with those from the logistic equation which mathematically describes the population growth, validating this model‚Äôs predictive capabilities.

‚ú®The second model introduces controlled spatial distribution of cells to demonstrate how cells react to the implementation of an artificial wound in a confluent monolayer of cells. The model was simulated for varying gap sizes to investigate the rate of gap closure over time. The wave propagation speed of the cell front for a gap size of 50% of the lattice was calculated and found consistent with expectations from the Fisher-Kolmogorov reaction-diffusion equation.

Overall, the models offer valuable insights into the dynamics of cell behaviour during wound healing as seen in cell culture. Future refinements to the models promise further advancements in the understanding of the wound healing processüë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è.
